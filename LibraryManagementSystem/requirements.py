'''
1. User Management:

Member Registration: Allow users (librarians, patrons) to register for the system with appropriate credentials.
Member Information Management: Store and manage member details like name, contact information, membership type, etc.
User Roles and Permissions: Define different user roles (librarian, student, faculty) with varying access levels and permissions (e.g., checkout privileges, overdue fines management).
Authentication and Authorization: Implement secure login mechanisms and control user access to specific features based on their roles.

2. Catalog Management:

Resource Addition: Facilitate adding different library resources (books, journals, DVDs, etc.) to the system.
Cataloging and Classification: Allow cataloging resources with details like title, author, ISBN, publication date, subject category, etc.
Search and Retrieval: Enable users to search for resources by title, author, keyword, subject, or other relevant criteria.
Resource Availability Tracking: Track the availability of resources (available, checked out, overdue, lost, etc.).
Resource Information Management: Maintain detailed information about each resource, including descriptions, reviews, ratings, and digital copies (if applicable).

3. Circulation Management:
Resource Checkout: Allow authorized users to borrow resources.
Loan Period Management: Set loan periods based on resource type and user membership category.
Renewals: Facilitate renewing checkouts before they become overdue.
Returns: Allow users to return borrowed resources.
Overdue Fines Management: Track overdue resources and calculate associated fines based on pre-defined rules.
Holds and Reserves: Enable users to place holds on resources that are currently checked out and be notified when they become available.

•	Key Functions:
•	Resource Checkout:
o	Users (patrons, students, faculty) can browse the library catalog and identify resources they want to borrow.
o	The system verifies user eligibility (membership status, outstanding fines) and resource availability (not checked out, not lost, etc.).
o	Once approved, the checkout process is completed, recording the loan details (borrower, resource, loan date, due date).

•	Loan Period Management:
o	The system defines loan periods based on factors like resource type (books, DVDs, equipment), user membership category (students, faculty, general public), and resource demand.
o	Loan periods are clearly communicated to users during checkout and through reminders.

•	Renewals:
o	Users can request to extend the loan period on borrowed resources before they become overdue.
o	The system validates eligibility for renewal (no holds on the item, user account in good standing) and might have limitations on the number of renewals allowed.

•	Returns:
o	Users return borrowed resources to the library.
o	The system scans the item (barcodes, RFID tags) to identify it and update its status in the database as "returned."
o	Any damage might be assessed during the return process.

•	Overdue Fines Management:
o	The system tracks the due dates of all borrowed resources.
o	When an item becomes overdue, automated notifications and fines are generated based on pre-defined rules (fines per day, maximum fine amount).
o	Users can view their overdue status and associated fines in their accounts.
•	Holds and Reserves:
o	Users can place holds on resources that are currently checked out by another borrower.
o	The system adds them to a waiting list and notifies them when the resource becomes available for checkout.


4. Inventory Management:

Track Resource Location: Keep track of the physical location of resources within the library (shelves, reference sections, etc.).
Inventory Reports: Generate reports on resource usage, availability, overdue items, and lost resources.
Acquisition Management: Manage the process of acquiring new resources, including purchase orders and vendor interactions.
Discard and Withdrawal: Facilitate removing resources from the library collection due to damage, loss, or obsolescence.

7. Reporting and Analytics:

Generate Reports: Allow generating reports on various aspects like resource usage, user borrowing patterns, overdue fines, and membership trends.
Data Analysis: Provide tools to analyze library usage data and identify areas for improvement or optimization.

6. Additional Considerations:

Search Functionality: Allow searching resources through advanced filters and search options.
User Interface: Design a user-friendly and intuitive interface for both librarians and patrons.
Accessibility: Ensure the system is accessible to users with disabilities.
Security: Implement robust security measures to protect user data and resource information.
Integration with Other Systems: Consider integration with other library systems like interlibrary loan or online catalogs.
Mobile Access: Provide options for mobile app access for users to manage accounts, search resources, and renew loans.
